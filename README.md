## How to Clone and Run the Code

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaPatterns.git

```

## How to Run the Java Program

### **Steps to Run the Java Program:**

1. **Open the Project in your IDE**  
   Open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or your preferred Java IDE).

2. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.  
   You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal:  

3. **Navigate to the `src` Folder**  
Inside the project directory, go to the `src` folder where the Java files are located.  
You will find two Java files:  
- `BasicPatterns.java`
- `AdvancedPatterns.java`

4. **Compile and Run the Java Files**  
- Open a terminal in VS Code (or use any terminal).
- Navigate to the `src` folder using the `cd` command:
  ```
  cd path/to/your/project/src
  ```
- To compile a Java file, run the following command:
  ```
  javac BasicPatterns.java
  ```
  or
  ```
  javac AdvancedPatterns.java
  ```
- After compilation, you will get `.class` files (like `BasicPatterns.class` or `AdvancedPatterns.class`).

5. **Run the Java Program**  
After compiling the Java files, run them using the `java` command:

```bash
java BasicPatterns
java AdvancedPatterns
```
